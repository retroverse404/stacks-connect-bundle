# Dev Project (runnable code only)

## Spec Workflow

Use the reusable feature-spec template to capture requirements before building:

```sh
npm run spec:new -- wallet-flow "Wallet Connect Flow"
```

The command copies `specs/templates/feature-spec-template.md`, fills in the basics, and saves the new document under `specs/` with the current date and slug.
